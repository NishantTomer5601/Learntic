## **Slide 1 – Title**

**RepoLens**
*AI-Powered Repository Explainer*

🏆 Hackathon Submission – Theme: Save Time | Improve Developer Experience

Team: \[Your Team Names]

---

## **Slide 2 – The Problem**

* Developers spend **days–weeks** understanding large repos
* Missing or outdated documentation
* Steep onboarding curve for new hires
* Hard to debug unfamiliar code

⚠️ Delays, higher costs, frustrated developers

---

## **Slide 3 – Our Solution**

**RepoLens = AI assistant for any repository**

* Builds a **DAG of repo dependencies**
* Each node = file/function/class
* Node actions:
  ✔️ **Summarize** → plain English explanation
  ✔️ **Explore further** → reveal downstream nodes
  ✔️ **Swagger link** for endpoints → instant API understanding

---

## **Slide 4 – Demo Walkthrough**

* Repo DAG visualization
* Summarization in action
* Expand & explore dependencies
* Endpoint → Swagger link

---

## **Slide 5 – Complete Product We’re Proposing**

* 🔌 **IDE Extensions (VS Code, IntelliJ)** – stay in workflow, compliance-friendly
* 📘 **Learning Assistant** – detect tech stack, link firm training/Coursera
* 📑 **Smart Docs Generator** – auto-create and update repo documentation
* ✅ **Code Review Accelerator** – summarize flows & impacted modules
* 🌐 **API Explorer** – Swagger links for endpoints

---

## **Slide 6 – Benefits**

* ⏱ **Save Time** → repo onboarding & debugging in minutes
* 💰 **Save Money** → reduce duplicate effort, faster delivery
* 😀 **Improve Developer Experience** → less frustration, easier learning
* 🔒 **Firm Advantage** → secure, promotes use of internal learning resources

---

## **Slide 7 – Real-World Scenarios**

* New hire onboarding → repo walkthrough + training links
* Cross-team projects → understand unfamiliar repos fast
* Incident management → trace impacted modules quickly
* API debugging → click DAG node → open Swagger → test instantly
* Legacy repos → generate documentation automatically

---

## **Slide 8 – How It Works (High Level)**

1️⃣ Parse repo → build dependency graph
2️⃣ AI summarization of nodes
3️⃣ Interactive DAG (UI / IDE plugin)
4️⃣ Integrations → Swagger, training resources, doc generator

## **Slide 9 – AI Models & Frameworks We Used**

| Tool/Model             | Usage in RepoLens                                   | Pros                                     | Cons                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT (OpenAI)**       | Summarization of nodes & explanations               | Strong reasoning, concise summaries      | Sometimes verbose, costly                    |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Long-context repo understanding                     | Handles large repos, safer outputs       | Slower, limited tooling                      |
| **Gemini (Google)**    | Technology detection & training recommendations     | Good at structured outputs, multilingual | Still evolving, less robust with large repos |
| **LangChain**          | Prompt orchestration & chaining tasks               | Flexible pipelines, easy LLM switching   | Adds complexity to setup                     |
| **LangGraph**          | Validation & structured workflow for node expansion | Ensures correctness, reliable flows      | Still maturing, smaller ecosystem            |

Do you want me to now also **design the visual diagrams** (like the architecture workflow + models/frameworks integration diagram) so you can drop them straight into Slides?
